      "A quadratic equation is a mathematical expression involving a variable (like \\(x\\)) raised to the second power (\\(x^2\\)). It follows the general form:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[\n",
      "ax^2 + bx + c = 0\n",
      "\\]\n",
      "\n",

      "- \\(x\\) is the variable we solve for.\n",
      "- The highest exponent of \\(x\\) is 2, which makes it \"quadratic.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Visualizing Quadratic Equations**\n",
      "Quadratic equations often represent **parabolas** when graphed on a coordinate plane. Depending on the values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), the parabola can open upward (like a \"U\") or downward (like an upside-down \"U\").\n",

      "- If \\(a > 0\\), the parabola opens **upward**.\n",
      "- If \\(a < 0\\), the parabola opens **downward**.\n",

      "\\[\n",
      "y = x^2 - 4x + 3\n",

      "x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\n",

      "\n",

      "\\[\n",
      "(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\n",
      "\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3: Solve for \\(x\\):\n",
      "\\[\n",
      "x - 2 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x - 3 = 0\n",
      "\\]\n",
      "\\[\n",

      "\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **2. Using the Quadratic Formula**\n",
      "The quadratic formula works for any quadratic equation. Itâ€™s given by:\n",

      "\\[\n",
      "x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n",

      "Example:\n",
      "Solve \\(2x^2 + 3x - 2 = 0\\).\n",
