The general form of a quadratic equation is:\n\n\\[\nax^2 + bx + c = 0\n\\]\n\nHere:\n- \\(x\\) is the variable.\n- \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are constants (numbers).\n- \\(a \\neq 0\\) (because if \\(a = 0\\), the equation becomes linear, not quadratic).\n\nQuadratic equations are important because they show up in many real-world scenarios, such as calculating areas, projectile motion, and optimizing profit or costs. Your goal when solving a quadratic equation is to find the values of \\(x\\) (called the **roots** or **solutions**) that make the equation true.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Step-by-Step Breakdown of Solving Quadratic Equations**\n\nThere are three main methods to solve quadratic equations:\n\n1. **Factoring**\n2. **Using the Quadratic Formula**\n3. **Completing the Square**\n\nLet\u2019s explore each method with visual and simple explanations.\n\n---\n\n##### **Method 1: Factoring**\n\nFactoring is like \"breaking apart\" the quadratic equation into two simpler expressions. \n\nExample:\nSolve \\(x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0\\) by factoring.\n\n**Step 1:** Look for two numbers that multiply to \\(c = 6\\) and add to \\(b = 5\\).  \n- These numbers are \\(2\\) and \\(3\\), because \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) and \\(2 + 3 = 5\\).\n\n**Step 2:** Rewrite the equation as:\n\\[\n(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Solve each part:\n\\[\nx + 2 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x + 3 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Step 4:** Find the solutions:\n\\[\nx = -2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = -3\n\\]\n\nThe roots are \\(x = -2\\) and \\(x = -3\\).\n\n---\n\n##### **Method 2: Quadratic Formula**\n\nThe **quadratic formula** is a universal tool that works for any quadratic equation. The formula is:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nExample:\nSolve \\(2x^2 + 3x - 2 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula.\n\n**Step 1:** Identify \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\):\n- \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 3\\), \\(c = -2\\).\n\n**Step 2:** Plug these values into the formula:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4(2)(-2)}}{2(2)}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Simplify the discriminant (\\(b^2 - 4ac\\)):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 16}}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4:** Simplify further:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{25}}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Step 5:** Find the two solutions:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-3 + 5}{4} = \\frac{2}{4} = 0.5\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-3 - 5}{4} = \\frac{-8}{4} = -2\n\\]\n\nThe roots are \\(x = 0.5\\) and \\(x = -2\\).\n\n---\n\n##### **Method 3: Completing the Square**\n\nThis method involves rearranging the equation to create a perfect square trinomial.\n\nExample:\nSolve \\(x^2 + 6x + 5 = 0\\) by completing the square.\n\n**Step 1:** Move \\(c = 5\\) to the other side:\n\\[\nx^2 + 6x = -5\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Add a number to both sides to make the left side a perfect square trinomial. Take half of \\(b = 6\\), square it (\\((6/2)^2 = 9\\)), and add \\(9\\):\n\\[\nx^2 + 6x + 9 = -5 + 9\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Simplify:\n\\[\n(x + 3)^2 = 4\n\\]\n\n**Step 4:** Solve for \\(x\\):\n\\[\nx + 3 = \\pm \\sqrt{4}\n\\]\n\n**Step 5:** Find the solutions:\n\\[\nx = -3 + 2 = -1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = -3 - 2 = -5\n\\]\n\nThe roots are \\(x = -1\\) and \\(x = -5\\).\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Examples and Applications**\n\n**Real-Life Example:** Projectile Motion  \nWhen you throw a ball, its height \\(h\\) can often be modeled by a quadratic equation like:\n\\[\nh = -16t^2 + 32t + 5\n\\]\nHere:\n- \\(t\\) is the time (seconds).\n- \\(h\\) is the height (feet).\n\nTo find when the ball hits the ground (\\(h = 0\\)), solve:\n\\[\n-16t^2 + 32t + 5 = 0\n\\]\n\nQuadratic equations also appear in:\n- Designing bridges and arches.\n- Calculating profit in business.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Practice Questions**\n\nTry solving these quadratic equations using any method:\n\n1. Solve \\(x^2 + 7x + 12 = 0\\).\n2. Solve \\(2x^2 - 8x + 6 = 0\\).\n3. Solve \\(x^2 - 10x + 25 = 0\\).\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Summary**\n\n- Quadratic equations are written in the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).  \n- The three main methods to solve them are factoring, using the quadratic formula, and completing the square.  \n- Quadratic equations are widely used in real-world applications, such as physics, engineering, and business.  \n\n**Visual Tip:** Try sketching a graph of a quadratic equation (\\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\)). It will look like a curve called a **parabola**, and the roots correspond to the points where the curve intersects the x-axis.\n\n---\n\n#### **Encouragement**\nYou're making great progress! Start with the practice questions, and don\u2019t hesitate to ask for more examples or detailed explanations as you go. Quadratic equations may seem tricky at first, but with practice, you'll master them!",
