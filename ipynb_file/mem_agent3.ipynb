      "Of course! Let's dive into addition step by step so you can fully understand it.\n",
      "\n",
      "### What is Addition?\n",
      "Addition is one of the basic operations in math that combines two or more numbers into a single number, called the **sum**. When you add numbers together, you're essentially counting how many things you have in total.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Vocabulary:\n",
      "1. **Addends**: The numbers you are adding together.\n",
      "2. **Sum**: The result of adding the numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example:\n",
      "If you add **3 + 5**, the numbers **3** and **5** are called **addends**, and the result, **8**, is called the **sum**.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### How to Add Numbers Step-by-Step:\n",
      "Letâ€™s break it down for you:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Case 1: Adding Small Numbers\n",
      "If youâ€™re adding small numbers, like **4 + 3**, follow these steps:\n",
      "1. Start with the first number (**4**).\n",
      "2. Count up by the second number (**3**).\n",
      "   - Start at 4, then count: 5, 6, 7.\n",
      "3. The sum is **7**.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Case 2: Adding Larger Numbers (Column Method)\n",
      "When you add larger numbers, like **47 + 35**, it's helpful to stack them vertically:\n",
      "```\n",
      "   47\n",
      "+  35\n",
      "------\n",
      "```\n",
      "1. Start with the **ones place** (rightmost digits):\n",
      "   - Add 7 (from 47) + 5 (from 35): **12**.\n",
      "   - Write down **2** in the ones place and **carry over 1** to the tens place.\n",
      "2. Move to the **tens place**:\n",
      "   - Add 4 (from 47) + 3 (from 35), and then add the carry-over 1: **8**.\n",
      "   - Write **8** in the tens place.\n",
      "3. Combine the digits to get the sum: **82**.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Examples:\n",
      "Letâ€™s look at a few examples:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Simple addition**:\n",
      "   - **5 + 6 = 11**\n",
      "   - Start with 5, count up 6 more: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Adding larger numbers**:\n",
      "   - **123 + 456**\n",
      "   - Align the numbers vertically:\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "       123\n",
      "     + 456\n",
      "     ------\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "     - Add the ones place: 3 + 6 = 9.\n",
      "     - Add the tens place: 2 + 5 = 7.\n",
      "     - Add the hundreds place: 1 + 4 = 5.\n",
      "     Sum = **579**.\n",
