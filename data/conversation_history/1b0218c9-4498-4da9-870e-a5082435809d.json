We then solve equations or expressions to find the value of these unknowns. It's like solving a puzzle!\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Breakdown\n\nLet\u2019s break down how algebra works step by step with the help of a visual explanation.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 1: Understand Variables**\n- A variable is a letter that stands for an unknown number. \n- Example: In \\(x + 5 = 10\\), the letter \\(x\\) is a variable, and our goal is to find what number \\(x\\) represents.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Set Up an Equation**\n- An equation is a math sentence that shows two expressions are equal. For example, \\(3x = 12\\) means \\(3\\) times some number (\\(x\\)) equals \\(12\\).\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Solve for the Variable**\nTo solve for the variable, we use **inverse operations**:\n- Addition \u2194 Subtraction\n- Multiplication \u2194 Division\n\nThe goal is to isolate the variable (get it alone on one side of the equation).\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4: Keep Both Sides Balanced**\nWhen solving equations, imagine a scale. Whatever you do to one side of the equation, you must also do to the other side to keep it balanced.\n\n---\n\n#### Visual Example: Solving \\(2x + 3 = 11\\)\n\nHere\u2019s how we solve an equation visually:\n\n1. **Start with the Equation**  \n   \\(2x + 3 = 11\\)  \n   Imagine this as a balance scale:  \n   - Left side: \\(2x + 3\\)  \n   - Right side: \\(11\\)\n\n   ![Scale with \"2x + 3\" and \"11\"](https://via.placeholder.com/300x150?text=Balance:+2x+%2B+3+=+11)\n\n2. **Step 1: Subtract 3 from Both Sides**  \n   To undo the \\(+3\\), subtract \\(3\\) from both sides:  \n   \\(2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3\\)  \n   \\(2x = 8\\)\n\n   Now the scale looks like this:  \n   ![Scale with \"2x\" and \"8\"](https://via.placeholder.com/300x150?text=Balance:+2x+=+8)\n\n3. **Step 2: Divide Both Sides by 2**  \n   To isolate \\(x\\), divide both sides by \\(2\\):  \n   \\(\\frac{2x}{2} = \\frac{8}{2}\\)  \n   \\(x = 4\\)\n\n   ![Scale with \"x\" and \"4\"](https://via.placeholder.com/300x150?text=Balance:+x+=+4)\n\n4. **Solution**  \n   \\(x = 4\\)\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\nLet\u2019s solve another equation together.  \n**Solve:** \\(5x - 7 = 18\\)\n\n1. **Add 7 to both sides**  \n   \\(5x - 7 + 7 = 18 + 7\\)  \n   \\(5x = 25\\)\n\n2. **Divide both sides by 5**  \n   \\(\\frac{5x}{5} = \\frac{25}{5}\\)  \n   \\(x = 5\\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(x = 5\\)\n\n---\n\n### Practice Question\n\nNow it\u2019s your turn to try!\n\n**Solve:** \\(4x + 6 = 22\\)\n\n---\n\nWhen you're done, share your solution with me, and I\u2019ll review it for you! \ud83d\ude0a"
