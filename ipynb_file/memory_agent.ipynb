      "### **Step-by-Step Solution (Factoring)**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Look for two numbers that multiply to the constant term (+10)** and add to the coefficient of \\(x\\) (-7).\n",
      "   - The two numbers are **-2** and **-5**, because:\n",
      "     \\[\n",
      "     (-2) \\times (-5) = +10 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (-2) + (-5) = -7\n",

      "2. **Rewrite the quadratic equation using these two numbers to factor:**\n",
      "   \\[\n",
      "   x^2 - 7x + 10 = (x - 2)(x - 5) = 0\n",
      "   \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Set each factor equal to zero:**\n",
      "   \\[\n",
      "   x - 2 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x - 5 = 0\n",
      "   \\]\n",

      "\n",

      "### **What This Means Graphically**\n",
      "If you graph \\(y = x^2 - 7x + 10\\), the parabola will cross the x-axis at \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = 5\\). These are the **x-intercepts** (or roots) of the quadratic equation.\n",

      "Now, substitute \\( t = 1 \\) into the original equation to find the height:\n",
