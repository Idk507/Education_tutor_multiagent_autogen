      "content": "### Quadratic Equations: A Comprehensive Explanation  \n\n---\n\n#### 1. **Introduction**  \nA **quadratic equation** is a type of equation in mathematics that involves a variable raised to the power of 2 (squared). It is a key concept in algebra and appears frequently in real-world applications, such as physics, engineering, economics, and more.  \n\nThe standard form of a quadratic equation is:  \n\\[\nax^2 + bx + c = 0\n\\]  \nWhere:  \n- \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are constants (numbers),  \n- \\(x\\) is the variable,  \n- \\(a \\neq 0\\) (because if \\(a = 0\\), the equation becomes linear, not quadratic).  \n\nA quadratic equation describes the shape of a **parabola** when graphed. The solutions to the equation are the values of \\(x\\) where the parabola intersects the x-axis (called the **roots**).  \n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Step-by-Step Breakdown**  \n\n##### **Step 1: Understanding the components**  \nLet’s take the equation:  \n\\[\n2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0\n\\]  \nHere:  \n- \\(a = 2\\) (the coefficient of \\(x^2\\)),  \n- \\(b = 3\\) (the coefficient of \\(x\\)),  \n- \\(c = -5\\) (the constant term).  \n\n##### **Step 2: Solving quadratic equations**  \nThere are three common methods to solve quadratic equations:  \n\n**a. Factoring**  \nFactoring involves rewriting the equation into two simpler expressions that multiply to give the original quadratic equation.  \nExample: Solve \\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\).  \nFactor into \\((x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\\).  \nSet each factor equal to 0:  \n\\[\nx - 2 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x - 3 = 0\n\\]  \nSo, \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = 3\\).  \n\n**b. Using the Quadratic Formula**  \nThe quadratic formula is:  \n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]  \nUse this formula when factoring is difficult or impossible.  \nExample: Solve \\(2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0\\).  \nSubstitute \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 3\\), \\(c = -5\\):  \n\\[\nx = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4(2)(-5)}}{2(2)}\n\\]  \n\\[\nx = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 40}}{4}\n\\]  \n\\[\nx = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{49}}{4}\n\\]  \n\\[\nx = \\frac{-3 \\pm 7}{4}\n\\]  \n\\[\nx = 1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = -\\frac{5}{2}\n\\]  \n\n**c. Completing the Square**  \nThis method involves rewriting the equation into a perfect square. It’s useful for understanding the properties of parabolas but less common for routine solving.  \n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Examples and Applications**  \n\n##### **Example 1: Real-world application**  \nImagine you’re throwing a ball in the air. The height of the ball, \\(h\\), at time \\(t\\) follows a quadratic equation:  \n\\[\nh = -5t^2 + 20t + 2\n\\]  \nHere:  \n- The ball’s motion is a parabola (the graph of the equation).  \n- Solving the equation \\(h = 0\\) gives the time when the ball hits the ground.  \n\n##### **Example 2: Problem-solving**  \nSolve \\(x^2 - 4x - 12 = 0\\) by factoring.  \nFactor into \\((x - 6)(x + 2) = 0\\).  \nSet each factor equal to 0:  \n\\[\nx - 6 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x + 2 = 0\n\\]  \nSo, \\(x = 6\\) and \\(x = -2\\).  \n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Practice Questions**  \n\n**Question 1:** Solve \\(x^2 + 3x - 10 = 0\\) by factoring.  \n\n**Question 2:** Use the quadratic formula to solve \\(3x^2 - 5x + 2 = 0\\).  \n\n**Question 3:** Write the quadratic equation whose roots are \\(x = 4\\) and \\(x = -3\\).  \n\n**Question 4:** A toy rocket’s height is given by \\(h = -16t^2 + 32t\\). When will the rocket reach the ground?  \n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Summary**  \n\n- A quadratic equation is any equation of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), where \\(a \\neq 0\\).  \n- The solutions to a quadratic equation are called **roots** and can be found using factoring, the quadratic formula, or completing the square.  \n- Quadratic equations appear in many real-world scenarios, especially those involving motion and optimization.  \n- Practice is key to mastering the concept, so solve questions regularly to build confidence.  \n\nVisualize quadratic equations by graphing them as parabolas and identifying their roots, vertex, and axis of symmetry. This approach connects abstract math to tangible understanding.",
