It seems like there was either a misunderstanding of the addition process or a possible error in calculation. Here's how to correctly solve it: First, line up the numbers vertically by place value: 23 on top and 45 below it. Add the digits in the ones place (3 + 5 = 8), then add the digits in the tens place (2 + 4 = 6). Combine these results to get 68 as the final sum. To improve, double-check your addition for each place value step-by-step to avoid simple mistakes. Practice solving similar addition problems to build confidence and accuracy.\",\n  \"performance_score\": 0.1\n}"
