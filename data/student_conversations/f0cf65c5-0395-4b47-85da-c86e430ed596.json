      "content": "# Quadratic Equations: A Comprehensive Explanation  \n\n### 1. **Introduction**  \nImagine you're launching a ball into the air. Its path forms a curve—a shape called a parabola. To describe this motion mathematically, we use *quadratic equations*. A quadratic equation is a type of equation that involves a variable (often \\(x\\)) raised to the power of 2.  \n\nThe standard form of a quadratic equation is:  \n\\[\nax^2 + bx + c = 0\n\\]  \nHere:  \n- \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are constants (numbers).  \n- \\(x\\) is the unknown value we're trying to solve.  \n- \\(a \\neq 0\\), because if \\(a = 0\\), the equation becomes linear, not quadratic.  \n\nQuadratic equations are everywhere—in physics, engineering, economics, and even everyday problem-solving.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. **Step-by-Step Breakdown**  \n\n#### **Step 1: Recognizing a Quadratic Equation**  \nA quadratic equation always has the highest power of \\(x\\) as 2. For example:  \n\\[\n2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0\n\\]  \nHere, \\(x^2\\) is the key term that makes it quadratic.\n\n#### **Step 2: Solving Quadratic Equations**  \nThere are three main methods to solve quadratic equations:  \n\n**Method 1: Factoring**  \nFactoring is breaking the equation into simpler parts that multiply to give the original equation.  \nExample: Solve \\(x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0\\).  \n1. Find two numbers that multiply to \\(6\\) (the constant term \\(c\\)) and add to \\(5\\) (the coefficient of \\(x\\)).  \n   These numbers are \\(2\\) and \\(3\\).  \n2. Rewrite the equation:  \n   \\[\n   (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0\n   \\]  \n3. Solve for \\(x\\):  \n   \\[\n   x + 2 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x + 3 = 0\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   x = -2 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = -3\n   \\]  \n\n**Method 2: Completing the Square**  \nThis involves rewriting the equation to make it easier to solve.  \nExample: Solve \\(x^2 + 6x + 5 = 0\\) using completing the square.  \n1. Move the constant to the other side:  \n   \\[\n   x^2 + 6x = -5\n   \\]  \n2. Add \\((\\frac{6}{2})^2 = 9\\) to both sides:  \n   \\[\n   x^2 + 6x + 9 = 4\n   \\]  \n3. Rewrite as a square:  \n   \\[\n   (x + 3)^2 = 4\n   \\]  \n4. Solve for \\(x\\):  \n   \\[\n   x + 3 = \\pm 2\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   x = -1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = -5\n   \\]  \n\n**Method 3: Quadratic Formula**  \nThe quadratic formula is a universal method:  \n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]  \nWhere:  \n- \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) come from the equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).  \n- The symbol \\(\\pm\\) means there are two solutions (positive and negative).  \n\nExample: Solve \\(2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0\\).  \n1. Identify \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 3\\), \\(c = -5\\).  \n2. Plug into the formula:  \n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4(2)(-5)}}{2(2)}\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 40}}{4}\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{49}}{4}\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-3 \\pm 7}{4}\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   x = 1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = -2.5\n   \\]  \n\n---\n\n### 3. **Examples and Applications**  \n\n#### **Example 1: Area Problem**  \nThe length of a rectangle is 2 more than its width, and its area is 24 square units. What are its dimensions?  \n1. Let the width be \\(x\\). Then the length is \\(x + 2\\).  \n2. Write the equation for area:  \n   \\[\n   x(x + 2) = 24\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   x^2 + 2x - 24 = 0\n   \\]  \n3. Solve using factoring:  \n   \\[\n   (x + 6)(x - 4) = 0\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   x = -6 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = 4\n   \\]  \n   Since width cannot be negative, \\(x = 4\\).  \n   Dimensions: Width = 4, Length = 6.  \n\n#### **Application: Physics (Projectile Motion)**  \nThe height \\(h\\) of a ball thrown upward is given by:  \n\\[\nh = -5t^2 + 20t + 30\n\\]  \nWhere \\(t\\) is the time in seconds. To find when the ball hits the ground, solve:  \n\\[\n-5t^2 + 20t + 30 = 0\n\\]  \nThis quadratic equation can be solved to predict the motion of the ball.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Practice Questions**  \n\n1. Solve \\(x^2 + 7x + 12 = 0\\) using factoring.  \n2. Solve \\(x^2 + 4x - 5 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula.  \n3. A garden has an area of 50 square meters. Its length is 5 meters more than its width. Find the dimensions of the garden.  \n4. Solve \\(3x^2 - 6x + 2 = 0\\) using completing the square.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. **Summary**  \nQuadratic equations are powerful tools in mathematics for solving problems involving curves, motion, and optimization. They are characterized by the \\(x^2\\) term and can be solved using factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula.  \n\nKey points:  \n- Standard form: \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).  \n- Three solving methods: Factoring, completing the square, quadratic formula.  \n- Applications include geometry, physics, and real-world problems.  \n\nTake time to practice the methods and apply them to real-life situations—you'll find quadratic equations are not only useful but also fascinating!",
